1
00:00:48,898 --> 00:00:50,025
Call: received

2
00:00:50,275 --> 00:00:53,695
<i>- Is everything in place?
- You're not to relieve me.</i>

3
00:00:53,945 --> 00:00:56,573
<i>I know, but I felt like taking a shift.</i>

4
00:00:57,115 --> 00:00:59,492
<i>You like him, don't you?
You like watching him.</i>

5
00:00:59,743 --> 00:01:02,746
<i>- Don't be ridiculous.
- We're going to kill him.</i>

6
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,457
<i>Morpheus believes he is the One.</i>

7
00:01:05,623 --> 00:01:06,666
<i>Do you?</i>

8
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,668
<i>It doesn't matter what I believe.</i>

9
00:01:08,918 --> 00:01:10,545
<i>You don't, do you?</i>

10
00:01:10,795 --> 00:01:12,881
<i>- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?</i>

11
00:01:13,089 --> 00:01:14,716
<i>Are you sure this line is clean?</i>

12
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:16,968
<i>Yeah, of course I'm sure.</i>

13
00:01:17,302 --> 00:01:18,762
<i>I better go.</i>

14
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,510
- Freeze! Police!
- Hands on your head!

15
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,136
Do it! Do it now!

16
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:24,160
- Lieutenant.
- Oh, shit.

17
00:02:24,994 --> 00:02:28,206
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders.

18
00:02:28,456 --> 00:02:30,166
I'm just doing my job.

19
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:35,213
You give me that "juris-my-dick-tion" crap,
you can cram it up your ass.

20
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:38,174
The orders were for your protection.

21
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:41,886
I think we can handle one little girl.

22
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:48,768
I sent two units!

23
00:02:49,018 --> 00:02:50,603
They're bringing her down now!

24
00:02:50,854 --> 00:02:53,982
No, lieutenant, your men are already dead.

25
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:24,137
Shit.

26
00:03:27,056 --> 00:03:29,142
Morpheus, the line was traced.
I don't know how.

27
00:03:29,392 --> 00:03:31,019
<i>I know. They cut the hard line.</i>

28
00:03:31,227 --> 00:03:33,396
<i>There's no time.
Get to another exit.</i>

29
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:36,065
- Are there any agents?
- <i>Yes.</i>

30
00:03:36,274 --> 00:03:37,442
Goddamn it.

31
00:03:37,692 --> 00:03:39,235
<i>You have to focus, Trinity.</i>

32
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,863
<i>There's a phone at Wells and Lake.</i>

33
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:43,907
<i>You can make it.</i>

34
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,825
- All right.
- <i>Go.</i>

35
00:04:47,971 --> 00:04:49,013
That's impossible.

36
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:26,009
Get up, Trinity. Just get up.

37
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:27,885
Get up.

38
00:06:13,765 --> 00:06:15,266
She got out.

39
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:16,851
It doesn't matter.

40
00:06:17,101 --> 00:06:20,271
- The informant is real.
- Yes.

41
00:06:20,438 --> 00:06:22,190
We have the name of their next target.

42
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,108
The name is Neo.

43
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:28,905
We'll need a search running.

44
00:06:29,197 --> 00:06:31,115
لقد بدأنا حقا

45
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,088
What?

46
00:07:32,844 --> 00:07:34,345
What the hell?

47
00:07:41,978 --> 00:07:43,938
"Follow the white rabbit."

48
00:07:55,783 --> 00:07:56,951
Who is it?

49
00:07:57,201 --> 00:07:58,494
It's Choi.

50
00:08:03,624 --> 00:08:05,460
Yeah. Yeah.

51
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:13,176
You're two hours late.

52
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,511
I know. It's her fault.

53
00:08:15,678 --> 00:08:16,763
You got the money?

54
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,057
Two grand.

55
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,059
Hold on.

56
00:08:39,744 --> 00:08:41,120
Hallelujah.

57
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,248
You're my savior.
My own personal Jesus Christ.

58
00:08:44,499 --> 00:08:46,375
You get caught using that...

59
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,753
I know. This never happened.
You don't exist.

60
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,964
- Right.
- Something wrong, man?

61
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:54,258
You look a little whiter than usual.

62
00:08:55,384 --> 00:08:57,553
My computer, it...

63
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:05,102
Ever have that feeling where you're
not sure if you're awake or dreaming?

64
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:08,648
All the time.
It's called mescaline.

65
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:11,275
It's the only way to fly.

66
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,654
It just sounds like you need to unplug.

67
00:09:15,404 --> 00:09:17,406
Get some R and R?

68
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:21,577
What do you think, Dujour?
Should we take him with us?

69
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:24,789
Definitely.

70
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,125
No, I can't. I have work tomorrow.

71
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:29,877
Come on.

72
00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:32,755
It'll be fun. I promise.

73
00:09:39,262 --> 00:09:40,763
Yeah.

74
00:09:41,597 --> 00:09:43,432
Sure. I'll go.

75
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,128
Hello, Neo.

76
00:10:13,462 --> 00:10:14,630
How do you know that name?

77
00:10:15,464 --> 00:10:17,174
I know a lot about you.

78
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,136
- Who are you?
- My name is Trinity.

79
00:10:21,095 --> 00:10:22,305
Trinity.

80
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:25,099
The Trinity?

81
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,268
That cracked the IRS D-base?

82
00:10:27,518 --> 00:10:28,978
That was a long time ago.

83
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:31,147
- Jesus.
- What?

84
00:10:31,606 --> 00:10:33,399
I just thought...

85
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:36,319
...you were a guy.

86
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,029
Most guys do.

87
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:41,449
That was you on my computer.

88
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,159
How did you do that?

89
00:10:43,826 --> 00:10:46,537
Right now, all I can tell you...

90
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:48,706
...is that you're in danger.

91
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:51,584
- I brought you here to warn you.
- Of what?

92
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:53,836
They're watching you, Neo.

93
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,839
- Who is?
- Please just listen.

94
00:11:00,343 --> 00:11:02,178
I know why you're here, Neo.

95
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,931
I know what you've been doing.

96
00:11:05,181 --> 00:11:07,058
I know why you hardly sleep...

97
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,478
...why you live alone and why,
night after night...

98
00:11:10,728 --> 00:11:13,064
...you sit at your computer.

99
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:15,775
You're looking for him.

100
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:19,570
I know, because I was once
looking for the same thing.

101
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:22,198
And when he found me...

102
00:11:22,823 --> 00:11:25,910
...he told me I wasn't
really looking for him...

103
00:11:26,827 --> 00:11:28,579
...I was looking for an answer.

104
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:32,333
It's the question that drives us, Neo.

105
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,670
It's the question that brought you here.

106
00:11:37,755 --> 00:11:39,131
You know the question...

107
00:11:39,382 --> 00:11:40,883
...just as I did.

108
00:11:42,426 --> 00:11:44,053
What is the Matrix?

109
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,764
The answer is out there, Neo.

110
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:49,433
It's looking for you.

111
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:51,894
And it will find you...

112
00:11:52,186 --> 00:11:54,188
...if you want it to.

113
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:01,946
Shit.

114
00:12:02,113 --> 00:12:03,322
Shit, shit.

115
00:12:13,582 --> 00:12:16,419
You have a problem
with authority, Mr. Anderson.

116
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:20,715
You believe that you are special,
that the rules do not apply to you.

117
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:23,426
Obviously, you are mistaken.

118
00:12:26,387 --> 00:12:29,265
This is one of the top software
companies in the world...

119
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:32,893
...because employees understand
they are part of a whole.

120
00:12:33,144 --> 00:12:37,773
Thus, if an employee has a problem,
the company has a problem.

121
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:43,237
The time has come to make
a choice, Mr. Anderson.

122
00:12:44,113 --> 00:12:47,992
Either you choose to be at your desk
on time from this day forth...

123
00:12:48,617 --> 00:12:51,203
...or you choose to find another job.

124
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,414
Do I make myself clear?

125
00:12:53,664 --> 00:12:56,083
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.
Perfectly clear.

126
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:05,426
Thomas Anderson?

127
00:13:07,678 --> 00:13:09,096
Yeah, that's me.

128
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,098
Okay.

129
00:13:17,104 --> 00:13:18,272
Great.

130
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,858
Have a nice day.

131
00:13:36,332 --> 00:13:37,374
Hello?

132
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:41,003
<i>Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?</i>

133
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,007
- Morpheus.
- <i>Yes.</i>

134
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,259
<i>I've been looking for you.</i>

135
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,679
<i>I don't know if you're ready
to see what I want to show you.</i>

136
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,100
<i>But unfortunately, you
and I have run out of time.</i>

137
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:58,062
<i>They're coming for you, and I don't
know what they're going to do.</i>

138
00:13:58,312 --> 00:13:59,647
Who's coming for me?

139
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:01,982
<i>Stand up and see for yourself.</i>

140
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:03,734
What? Right now?

141
00:14:04,026 --> 00:14:06,529
<i>Yes. Now.</i>

142
00:14:07,404 --> 00:14:09,281
<i>Do it slowly.</i>

143
00:14:09,698 --> 00:14:10,908
<i>The elevator.</i>

144
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,581
- Oh, shit!
- <i>Yes.</i>

145
00:14:22,253 --> 00:14:23,337
What do they want?

146
00:14:23,504 --> 00:14:26,841
<i>I don't know. If you don't want
to find out, get out of there.</i>

147
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:28,050
How?

148
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:31,428
<i>I can guide you, but you
must do exactly as I say.</i>

149
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:34,306
- Okay.
- <i>The cubicle across from you is empty.</i>

150
00:14:37,434 --> 00:14:39,562
- But what if they...
- <i>Go. Now.</i>

151
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,696
<i>Stay here for just a moment.</i>

152
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:58,664
<i>When I tell you, go to the end of the row...</i>

153
00:14:58,914 --> 00:15:00,875
<i>...to the office at the end of the hall.</i>

154
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,502
<i>Stay as low as you can.</i>

155
00:15:05,796 --> 00:15:06,922
<i>Go. Now.</i>

156
00:15:21,312 --> 00:15:24,857
<i>Good. Now, outside there is a scaffold.</i>

157
00:15:27,568 --> 00:15:29,904
- How do you know this?
- <i>We don't have time.</i>

158
00:15:30,154 --> 00:15:32,990
<i>To your left there's a window.
Go to it.</i>

159
00:15:35,242 --> 00:15:36,785
<i>Open it.</i>

160
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,413
<i>Take the scaffold to the roof.</i>

161
00:15:39,663 --> 00:15:42,249
No way! No way!
This is crazy!

162
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:44,877
<i>There are two ways out of this building.</i>

163
00:15:45,127 --> 00:15:48,923
<i>One is that scaffold.
The other is in their custody.</i>

164
00:15:49,173 --> 00:15:52,384
<i>You take a chance either way.
I leave it to you.</i>

165
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:57,723
This is insane!

166
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,768
Why is this happening to me?

167
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,686
What'd I do?

168
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:05,814
I'm nobody.
I didn't do anything.

169
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,858
I'm gonna die.

170
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,702
Shit!

171
00:16:38,973 --> 00:16:40,099
Oh, shit!

172
00:16:45,062 --> 00:16:46,855
I can't do this.

173
00:16:59,493 --> 00:17:00,536
Shit.

174
00:17:49,793 --> 00:17:54,631
As you can see, we've had our eye on you
for some time now, Mr. Anderson.

175
00:17:55,924 --> 00:17:58,594
It seems that you've been living...

176
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,971
...two lives.

177
00:18:02,389 --> 00:18:04,892
In one life, you're Thomas A. Anderson...

178
00:18:05,142 --> 00:18:08,479
...program writer for
a respectable software company.

179
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:12,816
You have a social security number.
You pay your taxes.

180
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:14,526
And you...

181
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:19,740
...help your landlady carry out her garbage.

182
00:18:22,242 --> 00:18:25,371
The other life is lived in computers...

183
00:18:25,662 --> 00:18:28,624
...where you go by the hacker alias "Neo"...

184
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:33,670
...and are guilty of virtually every
computer crime we have a law for.

185
00:18:34,963 --> 00:18:36,924
One of these lives...

186
00:18:37,174 --> 00:18:39,009
...has a future.

187
00:18:39,343 --> 00:18:41,345
And one of them does not.

188
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,894
I'm going to be as forthcoming
as I can be, Mr. Anderson.

189
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,230
You're here...

190
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,816
...because we need your help.

191
00:18:57,444 --> 00:19:00,447
We know that you've been
contacted by a certain...

192
00:19:00,697 --> 00:19:02,491
...individual.

193
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:07,454
A man who calls himself "Morpheus."

194
00:19:08,455 --> 00:19:12,459
Whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant.

195
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:15,129
He is considered by many authorities...

196
00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:18,424
...to be the most dangerous man alive.

197
00:19:21,135 --> 00:19:22,344
My colleagues...

198
00:19:22,803 --> 00:19:25,722
...believe that I am
wasting my time with you.

199
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:29,435
But I believe you wish
to do the right thing.

200
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:33,230
We're willing to wipe the slate clean...

201
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,732
...give you a fresh start.

202
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:39,153
All we're asking in return
is your cooperation...

203
00:19:39,403 --> 00:19:42,906
...in bringing a known terrorist to justice.

204
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:45,534
Yeah.

205
00:19:46,827 --> 00:19:48,912
That sounds like a really good deal.

206
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:52,291
But I got a better one.

207
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,042
How about...

208
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,462
...I give you the finger...

209
00:19:59,047 --> 00:20:01,049
...and you give me my phone call.

210
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,095
Mr. Anderson...

211
00:20:09,266 --> 00:20:10,309
...you disappoint me.

212
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,187
You can't scare me with this gestapo crap.

213
00:20:13,437 --> 00:20:14,813
I know my rights.

214
00:20:15,063 --> 00:20:16,565
I want my phone call.

215
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,318
Tell me, Mr. Anderson...

216
00:20:20,194 --> 00:20:21,612
...what good is a phone call...

217
00:20:21,862 --> 00:20:25,449
...if you're unable to speak?

218
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:01,443
You're going to help us, Mr. Anderson...

219
00:21:01,944 --> 00:21:04,112
...whether you want to or not.

220
00:22:02,546 --> 00:22:05,799
<i>This line is tapped, so I must be brief.</i>

221
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:10,345
<i>They got to you first, but they've
underestimated how important you are.</i>

222
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:12,431
<i>If they knew what I know...</i>

223
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:14,683
<i>...you would probably be dead.</i>

224
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:19,396
What are you talking about?
What is happening to me?

225
00:22:19,646 --> 00:22:24,484
<i>You are the One, Neo.
You may have spent the last few years...</i>

226
00:22:24,735 --> 00:22:27,696
<i>...looking for me,
but I've spent my entire life...</i>

227
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,448
<i>...looking for you.</i>

228
00:22:30,991 --> 00:22:33,160
<i>Now, do you still want to meet?</i>

229
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,997
- Yes.
- <i>Then go to the Adams Street bridge.</i>

230
00:22:47,215 --> 00:22:48,425
Get in.

231
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:01,521
What's this?

232
00:23:01,772 --> 00:23:04,316
It's necessary, Neo.
For our protection.

233
00:23:04,566 --> 00:23:06,735
- From what?
- From you.

234
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:09,738
- Take off your shirt.
- What?

235
00:23:09,905 --> 00:23:11,073
Stop the car.

236
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:16,828
Listen, coppertop.

237
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:19,081
We don't have time for 20 Questions.

238
00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:21,958
Right now, there's only one rule:

239
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,585
Our way...

240
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,003
...or the highway.

241
00:23:31,551 --> 00:23:32,636
Fine.

242
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:36,973
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.

243
00:23:37,557 --> 00:23:40,185
- Why?
- Because you have been down there.

244
00:23:40,936 --> 00:23:42,145
You know that road.

245
00:23:43,146 --> 00:23:44,773
You know exactly where it ends.

246
00:23:46,983 --> 00:23:49,236
And I know that's not where you want to be.

247
00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:04,960
Apoc, lights.

248
00:24:07,462 --> 00:24:09,631
Lie back. Lift up your shirt.

249
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,802
- What's that?
- You're bugged.

250
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,019
Try and relax.

251
00:24:29,317 --> 00:24:30,485
Come on.

252
00:24:31,528 --> 00:24:32,571
Come on.

253
00:24:34,322 --> 00:24:35,323
It's on the move.

254
00:24:37,117 --> 00:24:38,326
Come on, you shit.

255
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:42,414
- You're gonna lose it.
- No, I'm not.

256
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:43,665
Clear!

257
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,384
Jesus Christ!
That thing's real!?

258
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:29,461
This is it.

259
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:35,258
Let me give you one piece of advice.

260
00:25:36,218 --> 00:25:37,886
Be honest.

261
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,681
He knows more than you can imagine.

262
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:51,733
At last.

263
00:25:53,276 --> 00:25:54,361
Welcome, Neo.

264
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,489
As you no doubt have guessed...

265
00:25:57,739 --> 00:25:58,990
...I am Morpheus.

266
00:26:00,033 --> 00:26:01,618
It's an honor to meet you.

267
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:03,119
No...

268
00:26:03,703 --> 00:26:04,996
...the honor is mine.

269
00:26:05,914 --> 00:26:08,416
Please, come. Sit.

270
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,141
I imagine...

271
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:28,311
...that right now you're
feeling a bit like Alice...

272
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:32,440
...tumbling down the rabbit hole?

273
00:26:33,275 --> 00:26:34,359
You could say that.

274
00:26:35,277 --> 00:26:37,904
I can see it in your eyes.

275
00:26:38,488 --> 00:26:41,783
You have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees...

276
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:44,286
...because he's expecting to wake up.

277
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:48,290
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.

278
00:26:48,999 --> 00:26:51,376
Do you believe in fate, Neo?

279
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:52,627
No.

280
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:54,087
Why not?

281
00:26:54,337 --> 00:26:57,132
I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life.

282
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:01,553
I know exactly what you mean.

283
00:27:05,849 --> 00:27:08,226
Let me tell you why you're here.

284
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:10,812
You know something.

285
00:27:11,354 --> 00:27:12,981
What you know, you can't explain.

286
00:27:13,481 --> 00:27:15,066
But you feel it.

287
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,569
You felt it your entire life:

288
00:27:18,153 --> 00:27:22,324
Something's wrong with the world.
You don't know what, but it's there.

289
00:27:22,824 --> 00:27:25,035
Like a splinter in your mind...

290
00:27:25,285 --> 00:27:27,162
...driving you mad.

291
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,832
It is this feeling that has
brought you to me.

292
00:27:33,376 --> 00:27:35,211
Do you know what I'm talking about?

293
00:27:37,047 --> 00:27:38,381
The Matrix?

294
00:27:40,884 --> 00:27:42,552
Do you want to know...

295
00:27:43,011 --> 00:27:45,013
...what it is?

296
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,267
The Matrix is everywhere.

297
00:27:49,517 --> 00:27:51,227
It is all around us.

298
00:27:51,478 --> 00:27:53,438
Even now, in this very room.

299
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:56,483
You can see it when you
look out your window...

300
00:27:56,733 --> 00:27:59,069
...or when you turn on your television.

301
00:27:59,486 --> 00:28:02,030
You can feel it when you go to work...

302
00:28:03,573 --> 00:28:05,241
...when you go to church...

303
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:07,744
...when you pay your taxes.

304
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,790
It is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes...

305
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,625
...to blind you from the truth.

306
00:28:15,835 --> 00:28:17,087
What truth?

307
00:28:21,341 --> 00:28:22,884
That you are a slave.

308
00:28:24,386 --> 00:28:26,680
Like everyone else,
you were born into bondage...

309
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:31,601
...born into a prison that you
cannot smell or taste or touch.

310
00:28:31,893 --> 00:28:33,186
A prison...

311
00:28:33,436 --> 00:28:34,562
...for your mind.

312
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:43,905
Unfortunately, no one can be...

313
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:46,616
...told what the Matrix is.

314
00:28:50,078 --> 00:28:51,955
You have to see it for yourself.

315
00:29:01,464 --> 00:29:03,758
This is your last chance.

316
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:06,344
After this, there is no turning back.

317
00:29:06,803 --> 00:29:08,263
You take the blue pill...

318
00:29:08,596 --> 00:29:11,641
...the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe...

319
00:29:11,891 --> 00:29:13,685
...whatever you want to believe.

320
00:29:13,935 --> 00:29:15,270
You take the red pill...

321
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,480
...you stay in Wonderland...

322
00:29:17,981 --> 00:29:20,692
...and I show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.

323
00:29:30,577 --> 00:29:31,786
Remember...

324
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,665
...all I'm offering is the truth.
Nothing more.

325
00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:51,306
Follow me.

326
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,518
Apoc, are we on-line?

327
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:57,145
Almost.

328
00:30:00,482 --> 00:30:02,525
Time is always against us.

329
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,402
Please take a seat there.

330
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,297
- You did all this?
- Mm-hm.

331
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:30,428
The pill you took is part
of a trace program.

332
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:35,809
It disrupts your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location.

333
00:30:36,351 --> 00:30:37,393
What does that mean?

334
00:30:37,977 --> 00:30:40,146
It means buckle your seat belt, Dorothy...

335
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,815
...because Kansas...

336
00:30:42,065 --> 00:30:43,108
...is going bye-bye.

337
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,397
Did you...?

338
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:37,495
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?

339
00:31:38,955 --> 00:31:41,541
What if you were unable
to wake from that dream?

340
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:44,294
How would you know the difference
between the dream world...

341
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:46,337
...and the real world?

342
00:31:47,964 --> 00:31:49,132
This can't be.

343
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:50,341
Be what?

344
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,552
Be real?

345
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:57,932
- Going into replication.
- Apoc?

346
00:31:58,141 --> 00:31:59,142
Still nothing.

347
00:31:59,726 --> 00:32:00,935
It's cold.

348
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:02,562
It's cold!

349
00:32:06,441 --> 00:32:08,109
Tank, we'll need a signal soon.

350
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:12,280
- I got a fibrillation.
- Apoc, location.

351
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,990
Targeting almost there.

352
00:32:17,285 --> 00:32:18,703
He's going into arrest.

353
00:32:18,953 --> 00:32:21,456
- Lock. I got him!
- Now, Tank, now!

354
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:19,801
Welcome...

355
00:35:20,134 --> 00:35:22,053
...to the real world.

356
00:35:23,471 --> 00:35:25,306
We've done it, Trinity.

357
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:27,100
We found him.

358
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:30,144
- I hope you're right.
- I don't have to hope.

359
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:32,313
I know it.

360
00:35:37,485 --> 00:35:38,528
Am I dead?

361
00:35:39,028 --> 00:35:41,197
Far from it.

362
00:35:55,169 --> 00:35:56,587
He still needs a lot of work.

363
00:35:58,131 --> 00:35:59,215
What are you doing?

364
00:35:59,465 --> 00:36:01,676
Your muscles atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.

365
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,803
Why do my eyes hurt?

366
00:36:04,512 --> 00:36:06,389
You've never used them before.

367
00:36:10,143 --> 00:36:11,185
Rest, Neo.

368
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:13,104
The answers are coming.

369
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,263
Morpheus, what's happened to me?

370
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:30,973
What is this place?

371
00:37:31,224 --> 00:37:33,893
More important than "what" is "when."

372
00:37:34,393 --> 00:37:35,436
"When"?

373
00:37:35,645 --> 00:37:37,688
You believe it's the year 1999...

374
00:37:37,939 --> 00:37:40,191
...when in fact, it's closer to 2199.

375
00:37:41,317 --> 00:37:44,070
I can't tell you exactly what year it is...

376
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,947
...because we honestly don't know.

377
00:37:46,447 --> 00:37:49,283
There's nothing I can say
that will explain it for you.

378
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:52,286
Come with me.
See for yourself.

379
00:37:52,828 --> 00:37:54,580
This is my ship.

380
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:57,792
The <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>.
It's a hovercraft.

381
00:38:00,628 --> 00:38:02,380
This is the main deck.

382
00:38:08,135 --> 00:38:09,387
This is the core...

383
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:15,643
...where we broadcast our pirate
signal and hack into the Matrix.

384
00:38:19,021 --> 00:38:22,191
Most of my crew you already know.

385
00:38:27,196 --> 00:38:28,614
This is Apoc...

386
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:30,741
...Switch...

387
00:38:32,326 --> 00:38:33,494
- ...and Cypher.
- Hi.

388
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:37,456
The ones you don't know:
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.

389
00:38:38,332 --> 00:38:40,751
The little one behind you is Mouse.

390
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:48,342
You wanted to know what the Matrix is?

391
00:38:49,385 --> 00:38:50,595
Trinity.

392
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,200
Try to relax.

393
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,915
This will feel a little weird.

394
00:39:31,886 --> 00:39:33,262
This...

395
00:39:33,429 --> 00:39:35,139
...is the Construct.

396
00:39:35,556 --> 00:39:37,683
It's our loading program.

397
00:39:37,933 --> 00:39:40,394
We can load anything, from clothing...

398
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:42,021
...to equipment...

399
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:43,648
...weapons...

400
00:39:44,273 --> 00:39:46,108
...training simulations...

401
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:49,028
...anything we need.

402
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:54,241
Right now we're inside a computer program?

403
00:39:54,533 --> 00:39:56,452
Is it really so hard to believe?

404
00:39:56,952 --> 00:39:59,580
Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your body are gone.

405
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,875
Your hair has changed.

406
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:06,587
Your appearance now is what
we call "residual self-image."

407
00:40:07,296 --> 00:40:09,924
It is the mental projection
of your digital self.

408
00:40:15,805 --> 00:40:16,931
This isn't real?

409
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,724
What is "real"?

410
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,352
How do you define "real"?

411
00:40:21,644 --> 00:40:23,562
If you're talking about what you can feel...

412
00:40:23,813 --> 00:40:26,232
...what you can smell, taste and see...

413
00:40:26,482 --> 00:40:30,361
...then "real" is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain.

414
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,951
This is the world that you know.

415
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:41,414
The world as it was at the end
of the 20th century.

416
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:48,129
It exists now only as part
of a neural-interactive simulation...

417
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:49,630
...that we call the Matrix.

418
00:40:54,176 --> 00:40:56,971
You've been living in a dream world, Neo.

419
00:40:57,972 --> 00:40:59,098
This is the world...

420
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,142
...as it exists today.

421
00:41:14,196 --> 00:41:17,158
Welcome to "the desert...

422
00:41:18,033 --> 00:41:19,618
...of the real."

423
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:25,374
We have only bits and pieces of information.

424
00:41:25,624 --> 00:41:29,420
But what we know for certain
is that in the early 21 st century...

425
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:32,923
...all of mankind was united in celebration.

426
00:41:33,174 --> 00:41:37,928
We marveled at our own
magnificence as we gave birth to Al.

427
00:41:38,721 --> 00:41:39,847
Al.

428
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:42,266
You mean artificial intelligence.

429
00:41:42,516 --> 00:41:46,937
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.

430
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:51,233
We don't know who struck first, us or them.

431
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:54,862
But we know that it was us
that scorched the sky.

432
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,699
They were dependent on solar power...

433
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:02,286
...and it was believed that they
would be unable to survive...

434
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:06,123
...without an energy source
as abundant as the sun.

435
00:42:06,373 --> 00:42:11,253
Throughout human history, we have
been dependent on machines to survive.

436
00:42:12,713 --> 00:42:16,926
Fate, it seems,
is not without a sense of irony.

437
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:24,558
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.

438
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:28,938
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.

439
00:42:30,856 --> 00:42:33,025
Combined with a form of fusion...

440
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:38,197
...the machines had found
all the energy they would ever need.

441
00:42:42,243 --> 00:42:45,996
There are fields, Neo, endless fields...

442
00:42:46,247 --> 00:42:49,500
...where human beings are no longer born.

443
00:42:50,209 --> 00:42:52,044
We are grown.

444
00:42:58,092 --> 00:43:00,678
For the longest time, I wouldn't believe it.

445
00:43:00,928 --> 00:43:03,597
And then I saw the fields
with my own eyes...

446
00:43:04,932 --> 00:43:06,559
...watched them liquefy the dead...

447
00:43:06,809 --> 00:43:10,145
...so they could be fed
intravenously to the living.

448
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:14,942
And standing there,
facing the pure, horrifying precision...

449
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:18,112
...I came to realize
the obviousness of the truth.

450
00:43:20,739 --> 00:43:22,533
What is the Matrix?

451
00:43:23,742 --> 00:43:24,785
Control.

452
00:43:26,161 --> 00:43:29,540
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dream world...

453
00:43:30,332 --> 00:43:33,419
...built to keep us under control...

454
00:43:34,587 --> 00:43:37,756
...in order to change a human being...

455
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:39,550
...into this.

456
00:43:40,926 --> 00:43:42,052
No.

457
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:45,264
I don't believe it.

458
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:46,849
It's not possible.

459
00:43:47,433 --> 00:43:52,021
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.
I just said it would be the truth.

460
00:43:52,271 --> 00:43:53,564
Stop!

461
00:43:54,106 --> 00:43:55,316
Let me out!

462
00:43:56,025 --> 00:43:57,943
Let me out! I want out!

463
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:02,573
- Easy, Neo. Easy.
- Get this thing out of me.

464
00:44:02,823 --> 00:44:04,491
Get this thing out of me!

465
00:44:06,285 --> 00:44:07,786
Don't touch me!

466
00:44:08,037 --> 00:44:09,663
Stay away from me!

467
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,582
I don't believe it.

468
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:13,500
I don't believe it.

469
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:15,252
I don't believe it.

470
00:44:15,502 --> 00:44:17,546
- He's gonna pop.
- Breathe, Neo.

471
00:44:17,922 --> 00:44:19,006
Just breathe.

472
00:44:37,399 --> 00:44:39,193
I can't go back, can I?

473
00:44:40,027 --> 00:44:41,445
No.

474
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:43,489
But if you could...

475
00:44:44,323 --> 00:44:45,824
...would you really want to?

476
00:44:48,327 --> 00:44:49,703
I owe you an apology.

477
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:51,664
We have a rule.

478
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:55,376
We never free a mind once
it's reached a certain age.

479
00:44:55,542 --> 00:44:56,627
It's dangerous.

480
00:44:57,336 --> 00:44:59,046
The mind has trouble letting go.

481
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:01,590
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.

482
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,718
I did what I did because...

483
00:45:05,427 --> 00:45:06,887
...I had to.

484
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:19,400
When the Matrix was first built,
there was a man born inside...

485
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:23,696
...who had the ability to change
whatever he wanted...

486
00:45:24,071 --> 00:45:26,991
...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.

487
00:45:28,742 --> 00:45:32,204
It was he who freed the first of us...

488
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,707
...taught us the truth.

489
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:39,253
As long as the Matrix exists...

490
00:45:39,586 --> 00:45:41,672
...the human race will never be free.

491
00:45:45,884 --> 00:45:47,428
After he died...

492
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:50,889
...the Oracle prophesied his return...

493
00:45:51,432 --> 00:45:54,643
...and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the Matrix...

494
00:45:54,893 --> 00:45:56,562
...end the war...

495
00:45:56,895 --> 00:45:58,147
...bring freedom to our people.

496
00:45:59,481 --> 00:46:04,111
That is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the Matrix...

497
00:46:04,445 --> 00:46:06,030
...looking for him.

498
00:46:08,449 --> 00:46:10,534
I did what I did because...

499
00:46:12,161 --> 00:46:14,288
...I believe that search is over.

500
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:20,794
Get some rest.

501
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,213
You're going to need it.

502
00:46:25,924 --> 00:46:26,967
For what?

503
00:46:30,012 --> 00:46:31,221
Your training.

504
00:46:49,531 --> 00:46:51,241
Morning. Did you sleep?

505
00:46:52,117 --> 00:46:53,327
You will tonight.

506
00:46:53,702 --> 00:46:55,245
I guarantee it.

507
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,665
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.

508
00:46:59,124 --> 00:47:01,543
- You don't have any...
- Holes? Nope.

509
00:47:02,461 --> 00:47:07,174
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100%
pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.

510
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:08,634
Born free right here...

511
00:47:09,176 --> 00:47:10,511
...in the real world.

512
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:12,429
Genuine child of Zion.

513
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:15,724
- Zion?
- If the war was over tomorrow...

514
00:47:15,974 --> 00:47:17,476
...Zion's where the party would be.

515
00:47:17,893 --> 00:47:19,186
It's a city?

516
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:22,606
The last human city.
The only place we have left.

517
00:47:24,191 --> 00:47:25,442
Where is it?

518
00:47:27,194 --> 00:47:30,614
Deep underground near the Earth's core,
where it's still warm.

519
00:47:32,241 --> 00:47:34,118
You live long enough, you might see it.

520
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:41,208
Goddamn! I gotta tell you,
I'm excited to see what you're capable of...

521
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,210
...if Morpheus is right and all.

522
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:46,463
We're not supposed to talk
about this, but...

523
00:47:46,713 --> 00:47:48,132
...if you are...

524
00:47:49,216 --> 00:47:51,218
...it's a very exciting time.

525
00:47:52,261 --> 00:47:54,972
We got a lot to do.
We gotta get to it.

526
00:47:58,892 --> 00:48:01,812
We're supposed to start
with these programs first.

527
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:06,275
That's major boring shit.
Let's do something more fun.

528
00:48:06,608 --> 00:48:08,068
How about...

529
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:11,405
...combat training?

530
00:48:17,452 --> 00:48:18,912
"Jujitsu"?

531
00:48:19,788 --> 00:48:21,456
I'm going to learn jujitsu?

532
00:48:32,801 --> 00:48:34,011
Holy shit!

533
00:48:34,261 --> 00:48:36,597
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."

534
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:38,223
How about some more?

535
00:48:38,473 --> 00:48:39,766
Hell, yes.

536
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:42,895
Hell, yeah.

537
00:48:55,073 --> 00:48:56,158
How is he?

538
00:48:56,408 --> 00:48:58,577
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.

539
00:49:09,796 --> 00:49:11,173
I know kung fu.

540
00:49:12,841 --> 00:49:13,842
Show me.

541
00:49:15,636 --> 00:49:17,387
This is a sparring program...

542
00:49:17,638 --> 00:49:20,432
...similar to the programmed
reality of the Matrix.

543
00:49:20,682 --> 00:49:23,018
It has the same basic rules.
Like gravity.

544
00:49:23,268 --> 00:49:26,730
These rules are no different
than those of a computer system.

545
00:49:27,272 --> 00:49:28,774
Some of them can be bent.

546
00:49:28,982 --> 00:49:31,443
Others can be broken.

547
00:49:31,985 --> 00:49:33,070
Understand?

548
00:49:34,154 --> 00:49:35,197
Then hit me...

549
00:49:35,781 --> 00:49:36,907
...if you can.

550
00:50:15,904 --> 00:50:16,947
Good!

551
00:50:17,698 --> 00:50:18,865
Adaptation.

552
00:50:19,157 --> 00:50:20,367
Improvisation.

553
00:50:20,659 --> 00:50:21,994
But your weakness...

554
00:50:22,244 --> 00:50:23,620
...is not your technique.

555
00:50:30,585 --> 00:50:32,671
Morpheus is fighting Neo.

556
00:51:44,951 --> 00:51:46,119
How did I beat you?

557
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:53,794
You're too fast.

558
00:51:54,336 --> 00:51:55,670
Do you believe that...

559
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:58,548
...my being stronger or faster...

560
00:51:58,799 --> 00:52:02,469
...has anything to do
with my muscles in this place?

561
00:52:06,515 --> 00:52:08,308
You think you're breathing air?

562
00:52:21,822 --> 00:52:23,031
Again!

563
00:52:34,501 --> 00:52:36,920
Jesus Christ, he's fast!

564
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:39,381
His neuro-kinetics are way above normal.

565
00:52:44,845 --> 00:52:46,304
What are you waiting for?

566
00:52:46,555 --> 00:52:48,515
You're faster than this.

567
00:52:50,725 --> 00:52:52,936
Don't think you are.

568
00:52:53,186 --> 00:52:54,855
Know you are.

569
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:08,034
Come on! Stop trying to hit me, and hit me!

570
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:19,713
I don't believe it.

571
00:53:21,256 --> 00:53:23,383
I know what you're trying to do.

572
00:53:25,051 --> 00:53:27,220
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.

573
00:53:27,554 --> 00:53:29,639
But I can only show you the door.

574
00:53:30,223 --> 00:53:32,058
You have to walk through it.

575
00:53:34,436 --> 00:53:36,563
Tank, load the jump program.

576
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:50,869
You have to let it all go, Neo.
Fear...

577
00:53:51,411 --> 00:53:53,580
...doubt and disbelief.

578
00:53:54,748 --> 00:53:57,459
Free your mind.

579
00:54:05,717 --> 00:54:06,843
Whoa.

580
00:54:13,642 --> 00:54:15,352
Okey-dokey.

581
00:54:17,437 --> 00:54:18,605
Free my mind.

582
00:54:19,064 --> 00:54:20,190
What if he makes it?

583
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,151
- No one's ever made their first jump.
- I know.

584
00:54:24,486 --> 00:54:26,947
- But what if he does?
- He won't.

585
00:54:27,531 --> 00:54:28,615
Come on.

586
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:30,033
All right.

587
00:54:30,492 --> 00:54:32,536
No problem. Free my mind.

588
00:54:33,328 --> 00:54:36,122
Free my mind. No problem. Right.

589
00:54:55,517 --> 00:54:57,185
What does that mean?

590
00:54:57,561 --> 00:54:59,396
It doesn't mean anything.

591
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:02,566
Everybody falls the first time.

592
00:55:03,024 --> 00:55:04,317
Right, Trin?

593
00:55:25,005 --> 00:55:27,632
- I thought it wasn't real.
- Your mind makes it real.

594
00:55:30,885 --> 00:55:33,138
If you're killed in the Matrix...

595
00:55:33,305 --> 00:55:34,347
...you die here?

596
00:55:34,973 --> 00:55:37,434
The body cannot live without the mind.

597
00:56:07,922 --> 00:56:11,301
I don't remember you ever
bringing me dinner.

598
00:56:14,387 --> 00:56:17,223
There is something about him, isn't there?

599
00:56:17,849 --> 00:56:19,476
You're a believer now?

600
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:21,686
I keep wondering...

601
00:56:21,936 --> 00:56:25,607
...if Morpheus is so sure,
why not take him to see the Oracle?

602
00:56:26,524 --> 00:56:29,444
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.

603
00:56:39,245 --> 00:56:40,789
The Matrix is a system, Neo.

604
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:43,833
That system is our enemy.

605
00:56:44,459 --> 00:56:46,795
But when you're inside, what do you see?

606
00:56:47,045 --> 00:56:50,840
Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters.

607
00:56:51,299 --> 00:56:53,885
The very minds of the people
we are trying to save.

608
00:56:54,135 --> 00:56:57,097
But until we do, these people
are a part of that system...

609
00:56:57,347 --> 00:56:59,265
...and that makes them our enemy.

610
00:56:59,432 --> 00:57:00,642
You have to understand...

611
00:57:00,892 --> 00:57:04,229
...most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged.

612
00:57:04,479 --> 00:57:06,064
And many of them are so inert...

613
00:57:06,314 --> 00:57:08,733
...so hopelessly dependent on the system...

614
00:57:08,983 --> 00:57:11,695
...that they will fight to protect it.

615
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:16,950
Were you listening to me or looking
at the woman in the red dress?

616
00:57:17,117 --> 00:57:18,868
- I was...
- Look again.

617
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,204
Freeze it.

618
00:57:27,836 --> 00:57:29,462
- This isn't the Matrix?
- No.

619
00:57:31,256 --> 00:57:35,093
It's another training program
designed to teach you one thing:

620
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:38,138
if you are not one of us,
you are one of them.

621
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,474
- What are they?
- Sentient programs.

622
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:46,521
They can move in and out of any
software still hardwired to their system.

623
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:50,275
That means that anyone
we haven't unplugged...

624
00:57:50,608 --> 00:57:51,943
...is potentially an agent.

625
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:54,738
Inside the Matrix...

626
00:57:55,321 --> 00:57:57,031
...they are everyone...

627
00:57:57,365 --> 00:57:59,075
...and they are no one.

628
00:57:59,325 --> 00:58:02,454
We have survived by hiding
and running from them...

629
00:58:02,704 --> 00:58:04,330
...but they are the gatekeepers.

630
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:07,542
They're guarding all the doors
and holding all the keys.

631
00:58:07,792 --> 00:58:10,628
Sooner or later, someone will
have to fight them.

632
00:58:10,795 --> 00:58:12,005
Someone?

633
00:58:12,338 --> 00:58:13,757
I won't lie to you, Neo.

634
00:58:14,215 --> 00:58:19,053
Every single man or woman who has
fought an agent, has died.

635
00:58:19,304 --> 00:58:21,681
But where they have failed,
you will succeed.

636
00:58:21,848 --> 00:58:22,932
Why?

637
00:58:23,183 --> 00:58:25,477
I've seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall.

638
00:58:25,727 --> 00:58:29,314
Men have emptied entire clips
at them and hit nothing but air.

639
00:58:29,564 --> 00:58:34,194
Yet their strength and speed are
still based in a world built on rules.

640
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:35,570
Because of that...

641
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:39,199
...they will never be as strong
or as fast as you can be.

642
00:58:43,495 --> 00:58:45,371
What are you telling me?

643
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,540
That I can dodge bullets?

644
00:58:49,542 --> 00:58:50,919
No, Neo.

645
00:58:51,419 --> 00:58:54,339
I'm trying to tell you
that when you're ready...

646
00:58:55,215 --> 00:58:56,549
...you won't have to.

647
00:59:00,678 --> 00:59:01,888
<i>We got trouble.</i>

648
00:59:20,824 --> 00:59:23,284
- Did Zion send the warning?
- No, another ship.

649
00:59:26,538 --> 00:59:27,831
Shit.

650
00:59:28,081 --> 00:59:30,959
- Squiddy's sweeping in quick.
- Squiddy?

651
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:34,379
A sentinel. A killing machine
designed for one thing.

652
00:59:34,629 --> 00:59:35,839
Search and destroy.

653
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:38,341
Set her down there.

654
00:59:59,612 --> 01:00:01,114
How are we doing, Tank?

655
01:00:09,831 --> 01:00:10,999
Power off-line.

656
01:00:11,499 --> 01:00:13,459
EMP armed...

657
01:00:14,002 --> 01:00:15,545
- ...and ready.
- EMP?

658
01:00:15,837 --> 01:00:17,714
Electromagnetic pulse.

659
01:00:17,964 --> 01:00:20,842
Disables any electrical
system in the blast radius.

660
01:00:21,009 --> 01:00:23,303
It's the only weapon we have
against the machines.

661
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:32,228
- Where are we?
- Their old service and waste systems.

662
01:00:33,479 --> 01:00:34,606
Sewers.

663
01:00:34,814 --> 01:00:37,525
There used to be cities that
spanned hundreds of miles.

664
01:00:38,026 --> 01:00:39,944
Now these sewers are all that's left.

665
01:00:40,194 --> 01:00:41,529
Quiet.

666
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:23,571
Whoa! Neo.

667
01:01:25,406 --> 01:01:27,575
You scared the bejesus out of me.

668
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:30,578
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

669
01:01:33,081 --> 01:01:34,332
Is that...?

670
01:01:34,582 --> 01:01:36,167
The Matrix?

671
01:01:36,334 --> 01:01:37,543
Yeah.

672
01:01:39,337 --> 01:01:42,507
- Do you always look at it encoded?
- Well, you have to.

673
01:01:42,757 --> 01:01:45,843
The image translators work
for the construct program.

674
01:01:46,094 --> 01:01:49,514
But there's way too much
information to decode the Matrix.

675
01:01:49,764 --> 01:01:52,725
You get used to it.
I don't even see the code.

676
01:01:52,976 --> 01:01:56,396
All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.

677
01:01:57,563 --> 01:01:58,940
Do you...

678
01:01:59,232 --> 01:02:00,316
...want a drink?

679
01:02:00,566 --> 01:02:01,609
Sure.

680
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:06,614
You know...

681
01:02:07,532 --> 01:02:09,075
...I know what you're thinking.

682
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:11,411
Because right now I'm
thinking the same thing.

683
01:02:11,744 --> 01:02:15,081
Actually, I've been thinking it
ever since I got here.

684
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,003
Why, oh, why didn't I take the blue pill?

685
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:34,308
Good shit, huh?

686
01:02:34,642 --> 01:02:35,852
Dozer makes it.

687
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:37,478
It's good for two things:

688
01:02:37,729 --> 01:02:40,815
Degreasing engines and killing brain cells.

689
01:02:41,816 --> 01:02:44,027
So can I ask you something?

690
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:48,656
Did he tell you why he did it?

691
01:02:51,284 --> 01:02:53,119
Why you're here?

692
01:02:56,789 --> 01:02:58,541
Jesus!

693
01:02:59,751 --> 01:03:01,669
What a mind job.

694
01:03:03,087 --> 01:03:05,882
So you're here to save the world.

695
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:09,469
What do you say to something like that?

696
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,017
A little piece of advice.

697
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:19,228
You see an agent...

698
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:21,856
...you do what we do:

699
01:03:22,190 --> 01:03:23,733
Run.

700
01:03:24,067 --> 01:03:25,818
You run your ass off.

701
01:03:33,076 --> 01:03:34,786
Thanks for the drink.

702
01:03:39,499 --> 01:03:40,666
Sweet dreams.

703
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:48,091
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

704
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:49,884
You know...

705
01:03:51,302 --> 01:03:53,763
...I know this steak doesn't exist.

706
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:57,517
I know that when I put it in my mouth...

707
01:03:57,767 --> 01:04:00,853
...the Matrix is telling my brain that it is...

708
01:04:01,145 --> 01:04:02,271
...juicy...

709
01:04:02,563 --> 01:04:04,273
...and delicious.

710
01:04:07,193 --> 01:04:08,444
After nine years...

711
01:04:09,487 --> 01:04:11,030
...you know what I realize?

712
01:04:18,871 --> 01:04:20,081
Ignorance is bliss.

713
01:04:25,128 --> 01:04:26,963
Then we have a deal.

714
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:31,384
I don't want to remember nothing.

715
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:34,137
Nothing. You understand?

716
01:04:38,015 --> 01:04:40,017
And I want to be rich.

717
01:04:41,352 --> 01:04:44,063
You know, someone important.

718
01:04:45,565 --> 01:04:46,691
Like an actor.

719
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:51,028
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

720
01:04:53,197 --> 01:04:54,740
Okay.

721
01:04:55,116 --> 01:04:57,535
You get my body back in a power plant...

722
01:04:57,910 --> 01:04:59,662
...reinsert me into the Matrix...

723
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:01,414
...I'll get you what you want.

724
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:03,666
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.

725
01:05:03,916 --> 01:05:06,085
No. I told you, I don't know them.

726
01:05:09,046 --> 01:05:11,048
I can get you the man who does.

727
01:05:11,799 --> 01:05:13,593
Morpheus.

728
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:27,148
Here you go, buddy.
Breakfast of champions.

729
01:05:28,482 --> 01:05:31,277
Close your eyes, it feels like
you're eating runny eggs.

730
01:05:31,485 --> 01:05:33,196
Or a bowl of snot.

731
01:05:33,738 --> 01:05:35,323
You know what it reminds me of?

732
01:05:37,158 --> 01:05:39,493
Tastee Wheat.
Did you ever eat Tastee Wheat?

733
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:41,829
No, but technically, neither did you.

734
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:44,123
That's exactly my point. Exactly.

735
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:45,750
Because you have to wonder...

736
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,253
...how do the machines really know
what Tastee Wheat tasted like?

737
01:05:49,503 --> 01:05:50,922
Maybe they got it wrong.

738
01:05:51,172 --> 01:05:54,383
Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat
tasted like, actually tasted like...

739
01:05:54,675 --> 01:05:56,677
...oatmeal or tuna fish.

740
01:05:57,053 --> 01:05:59,889
That makes you wonder.
Take chicken, for example.

741
01:06:00,139 --> 01:06:02,141
Maybe they didn't know
what to make it taste like...

742
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:04,435
...which is why it tastes like everything.

743
01:06:04,685 --> 01:06:06,479
- And maybe they...
- Shut up.

744
01:06:08,105 --> 01:06:09,565
It's a single-celled protein...

745
01:06:09,815 --> 01:06:12,860
...combined with synthetic aminos,
vitamins and minerals.

746
01:06:13,110 --> 01:06:14,362
Everything the body needs.

747
01:06:14,612 --> 01:06:17,490
It doesn't have everything the body needs.

748
01:06:20,243 --> 01:06:23,329
I understand you've run through
the agent training program.

749
01:06:24,372 --> 01:06:26,415
You know, I wrote that program.

750
01:06:26,707 --> 01:06:28,000
Here it comes.

751
01:06:28,251 --> 01:06:30,211
- What did you think of her?
- Of who?

752
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:33,631
The woman in the red dress.
I designed her.

753
01:06:33,965 --> 01:06:36,717
She doesn't talk very much...

754
01:06:36,968 --> 01:06:40,930
...but if you'd like to meet her,
I can arrange a more personal milieu.

755
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:42,556
The digital pimp hard at work.

756
01:06:42,807 --> 01:06:45,059
Pay no attention to these hypocrites, Neo.

757
01:06:46,352 --> 01:06:48,187
To deny our own impulses...

758
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:51,565
...is to deny the very thing
that makes us human.

759
01:06:53,484 --> 01:06:54,860
Dozer, when you're done...

760
01:06:55,069 --> 01:06:56,654
...bring the ship up to broadcast depth.

761
01:06:57,238 --> 01:06:58,572
We're going in.

762
01:06:59,282 --> 01:07:00,700
I'm taking Neo to see her.

763
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:05,871
See who?

764
01:07:06,872 --> 01:07:08,124
The Oracle.

765
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:15,172
Everyone please observe...

766
01:07:15,506 --> 01:07:18,217
...the "fasten seat belt" and
"no smoking" signs are on.

767
01:07:18,718 --> 01:07:22,096
Sit back and enjoy your flight.

768
01:07:46,537 --> 01:07:47,538
We're in.

769
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:04,347
We'll be back in an hour.

770
01:08:19,111 --> 01:08:21,113
Unbelievable...

771
01:08:21,364 --> 01:08:22,698
...isn't it?

772
01:08:26,285 --> 01:08:28,120
- God!
- What?

773
01:08:28,788 --> 01:08:30,164
I used to eat there.

774
01:08:32,416 --> 01:08:34,043
Really good noodles.

775
01:08:38,839 --> 01:08:41,342
I have these memories from my life.

776
01:08:43,803 --> 01:08:45,471
None of them happened.

777
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:47,431
What does that mean?

778
01:08:47,681 --> 01:08:49,892
That the Matrix cannot
tell you who you are.

779
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:52,019
But an oracle can?

780
01:08:52,478 --> 01:08:53,687
That's different.

781
01:08:58,401 --> 01:08:59,652
Did you go to her?

782
01:09:01,195 --> 01:09:02,363
Yes.

783
01:09:02,863 --> 01:09:04,240
What did she tell you?

784
01:09:07,493 --> 01:09:08,994
She told me...

785
01:09:10,037 --> 01:09:11,205
What?

786
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,335
We're here.

787
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:19,004
Neo, come with me.

788
01:09:38,983 --> 01:09:41,402
So is this the same oracle that made...

789
01:09:41,569 --> 01:09:42,820
...the prophecy?

790
01:09:43,070 --> 01:09:47,408
Yes. She's very old. She's been
with us since the beginning.

791
01:09:47,867 --> 01:09:49,869
- The beginning?
- Of the Resistance.

792
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:54,498
And she knows what? Everything?

793
01:09:56,542 --> 01:09:58,461
She would say she knows enough.

794
01:09:59,587 --> 01:10:01,380
And she's never wrong.

795
01:10:03,591 --> 01:10:06,760
Try not to think of it in terms
of right and wrong.

796
01:10:07,094 --> 01:10:08,679
She is a guide, Neo.

797
01:10:09,054 --> 01:10:10,931
She can help you to find the path.

798
01:10:11,432 --> 01:10:12,683
She helped you?

799
01:10:13,392 --> 01:10:14,435
Yes.

800
01:10:15,186 --> 01:10:16,520
What did she tell you?

801
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:21,192
That I would find the One.

802
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:36,457
I told you I can only
show you the door.

803
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:39,251
You have to walk through it.

804
01:10:43,047 --> 01:10:44,131
Hello, Neo.

805
01:10:44,381 --> 01:10:46,050
You're right on time.

806
01:10:53,974 --> 01:10:57,770
Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
Neo, come with me.

807
01:11:03,442 --> 01:11:05,027
These are the other Potentials.

808
01:11:05,277 --> 01:11:06,820
You can wait here.

809
01:11:47,653 --> 01:11:50,197
Do not try and bend the spoon.

810
01:11:50,573 --> 01:11:52,700
That's impossible.

811
01:11:53,534 --> 01:11:57,538
Instead, only try to realize the truth.

812
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,456
What truth?

813
01:11:59,707 --> 01:12:01,375
There is no spoon.

814
01:12:03,961 --> 01:12:05,296
There is no spoon?

815
01:12:05,546 --> 01:12:10,009
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon
that bends. It is only yourself.

816
01:12:26,066 --> 01:12:27,526
The Oracle will you see now.

817
01:12:38,245 --> 01:12:39,788
I know you're Neo.

818
01:12:40,414 --> 01:12:41,582
Be right with you.

819
01:12:42,625 --> 01:12:45,002
- You're the Oracle?
- Bingo.

820
01:12:47,713 --> 01:12:50,591
Not quite what you were expecting, right?

821
01:12:51,634 --> 01:12:53,802
Almost done.

822
01:12:56,305 --> 01:12:57,931
Smell good, don't they?

823
01:12:59,183 --> 01:13:00,434
Yeah.

824
01:13:00,684 --> 01:13:02,519
I'd ask you to sit down...

825
01:13:02,770 --> 01:13:05,147
...but you're not going to anyway.

826
01:13:05,648 --> 01:13:08,525
- And don't worry about the vase.
- What vase?

827
01:13:11,654 --> 01:13:12,821
That vase.

828
01:13:13,781 --> 01:13:14,823
I'm sorry.

829
01:13:15,074 --> 01:13:16,950
I said, don't worry about it.

830
01:13:18,118 --> 01:13:20,079
I'll get one of my kids to fix it.

831
01:13:20,704 --> 01:13:21,914
How did you know?

832
01:13:23,957 --> 01:13:27,753
What's really going to bake
your noodle later on is...

833
01:13:28,087 --> 01:13:31,048
...would you still have broken it
if I hadn't said anything?

834
01:13:35,844 --> 01:13:37,763
You're cuter than I thought.

835
01:13:40,808 --> 01:13:43,060
I can see why she likes you.

836
01:13:43,936 --> 01:13:45,020
Who?

837
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:47,106
Not too bright, though.

838
01:13:50,401 --> 01:13:53,487
You know why Morpheus
brought you to see me.

839
01:13:55,614 --> 01:13:56,782
So...

840
01:13:57,741 --> 01:13:59,118
...what do you think?

841
01:14:00,953 --> 01:14:02,705
Do you think you are the One?

842
01:14:04,665 --> 01:14:05,708
I don't know.

843
01:14:09,128 --> 01:14:10,546
You know what that means?

844
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:12,548
It's Latin.

845
01:14:12,923 --> 01:14:15,134
Means, "Know thyself."

846
01:14:16,593 --> 01:14:18,554
I'll let you in on a little secret.

847
01:14:20,806 --> 01:14:24,643
Being the One is just like being in love.

848
01:14:25,352 --> 01:14:28,230
No one can tell you you're in love.
You just know it...

849
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:29,606
...through and through.

850
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:31,984
Balls to bones.

851
01:14:34,319 --> 01:14:35,362
Well...

852
01:14:37,322 --> 01:14:39,408
...I'd better have a look at you.

853
01:14:40,743 --> 01:14:42,244
Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."

854
01:14:56,633 --> 01:14:58,302
Okay...

855
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:03,891
Now I'm supposed to say,
"Hmm, that's interesting, but..."

856
01:15:04,391 --> 01:15:05,517
Then you say:

857
01:15:06,185 --> 01:15:07,394
But what?

858
01:15:07,644 --> 01:15:11,607
But you already know
what I'm going to tell you.

859
01:15:13,025 --> 01:15:15,986
- I'm not the One.
- Sorry, kid.

860
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:19,615
You got the gift...

861
01:15:20,532 --> 01:15:22,826
...but it looks like you're
waiting for something.

862
01:15:27,498 --> 01:15:28,540
What?

863
01:15:28,791 --> 01:15:31,668
Your next life, maybe. Who knows?

864
01:15:32,252 --> 01:15:34,505
That's the way these things go.

865
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:37,966
- What's funny?
- Morpheus.

866
01:15:41,428 --> 01:15:43,138
He almost had me convinced.

867
01:15:43,388 --> 01:15:44,515
I know.

868
01:15:46,058 --> 01:15:48,185
Poor Morpheus.

869
01:15:50,562 --> 01:15:53,690
Without him, we're lost.

870
01:15:55,234 --> 01:15:57,402
What do you mean, "without him"?

871
01:16:01,406 --> 01:16:03,325
Are you sure you want to hear this?

872
01:16:05,536 --> 01:16:08,288
Morpheus believes in you, Neo.

873
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:12,167
And no one, not you, not even me...

874
01:16:12,417 --> 01:16:14,670
...can convince him otherwise.

875
01:16:15,045 --> 01:16:17,422
He believes it so blindly...

876
01:16:17,714 --> 01:16:22,052
...that he's going to sacrifice
his life to save yours.

877
01:16:22,261 --> 01:16:23,428
What?

878
01:16:23,595 --> 01:16:26,265
You're going to have to make a choice.

879
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:30,477
In the one hand,
you'll have Morpheus' life.

880
01:16:30,978 --> 01:16:33,856
And in the other hand,
you'll have your own.

881
01:16:35,274 --> 01:16:37,568
One of you is going to die.

882
01:16:39,653 --> 01:16:42,948
Which one will be up to you.

883
01:16:44,324 --> 01:16:46,243
I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am.

884
01:16:46,493 --> 01:16:48,161
You have a good soul.

885
01:16:49,246 --> 01:16:51,957
And I hate giving good people bad news.

886
01:16:55,085 --> 01:16:56,545
Don't worry about it.

887
01:16:56,795 --> 01:16:59,214
As soon as you step outside that door...

888
01:16:59,464 --> 01:17:01,592
...you'll start feeling better.

889
01:17:02,301 --> 01:17:06,096
You'll remember you don't believe
in any of this fate crap.

890
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:09,683
You're in control of your own life.

891
01:17:10,517 --> 01:17:11,810
Remember?

892
01:17:13,478 --> 01:17:14,688
Here...

893
01:17:16,565 --> 01:17:18,108
...take a cookie.

894
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:21,987
I promise, by the time
you're done eating it...

895
01:17:22,946 --> 01:17:25,324
...you'll feel right as rain.

896
01:17:34,541 --> 01:17:35,876
What was said...

897
01:17:36,501 --> 01:17:37,961
...was for you...

898
01:17:38,503 --> 01:17:40,339
...and for you alone.

899
01:18:03,278 --> 01:18:04,363
They're on the way.

900
01:18:34,184 --> 01:18:35,227
What is that?

901
01:18:49,992 --> 01:18:51,410
Oh, déjà vu.

902
01:18:54,913 --> 01:18:55,998
What did you just say?

903
01:18:56,248 --> 01:18:57,749
Nothing.
Just déjà vu.

904
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,626
- What did you see?
- What happened?

905
01:19:01,044 --> 01:19:03,213
A black cat went past us...

906
01:19:03,463 --> 01:19:05,090
...then another just like it.

907
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:06,883
Was it the same cat?

908
01:19:07,843 --> 01:19:10,679
- I'm not sure.
- Switch, Apoc.

909
01:19:14,766 --> 01:19:15,976
What is it?

910
01:19:16,226 --> 01:19:20,647
A déjà vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix
when they change something.

911
01:19:23,608 --> 01:19:24,860
Oh, my God.

912
01:19:26,653 --> 01:19:27,654
Let's go.

913
01:19:32,909 --> 01:19:34,703
They cut the hard line.
It's a trap! Get out!

914
01:19:40,167 --> 01:19:41,418
Oh, no.

915
01:20:21,708 --> 01:20:24,169
That's what they changed.
We're trapped.

916
01:20:24,419 --> 01:20:26,296
Be calm. Give me your phone.

917
01:20:26,546 --> 01:20:28,090
They'll be able to track it.

918
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:29,758
We have no choice.

919
01:20:31,176 --> 01:20:32,385
Operator.

920
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:35,555
<i>Find a structural drawing of this building.
Find it fast.</i>

921
01:20:43,396 --> 01:20:45,982
- Got it!
- <i>I need the main wet-wall.</i>

922
01:20:48,819 --> 01:20:50,070
Eighth floor.

923
01:20:50,278 --> 01:20:51,863
<i>They're on the eighth floor.</i>

924
01:20:52,155 --> 01:20:53,615
Switch, straight ahead.

925
01:20:54,366 --> 01:20:55,534
Neo...

926
01:21:01,665 --> 01:21:03,792
I hope the Oracle gave you
some good news.

927
01:21:12,092 --> 01:21:13,593
<i>Now left. That's it.</i>

928
01:21:13,885 --> 01:21:14,928
Good.

929
01:21:24,646 --> 01:21:25,939
Where are they?

930
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:27,542
They're in the walls.

931
01:22:29,002 --> 01:22:30,170
In the walls!

932
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:53,235
It's an agent!

933
01:23:00,533 --> 01:23:01,868
Morpheus!

934
01:23:02,035 --> 01:23:03,286
You must get Neo out!

935
01:23:03,536 --> 01:23:05,372
He's all that matters!

936
01:23:05,664 --> 01:23:07,874
- No, Morpheus! Don't!
- Trinity, go!

937
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:10,168
Go!

938
01:23:16,424 --> 01:23:18,343
- We can't leave him!
- We have to!

939
01:23:42,659 --> 01:23:44,452
Cypher, come on!

940
01:23:49,374 --> 01:23:53,211
The great Morpheus.
We meet at last.

941
01:23:53,753 --> 01:23:54,879
And you are?

942
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:56,881
A Smith.

943
01:23:57,132 --> 01:23:58,425
Agent Smith.

944
01:23:59,009 --> 01:24:01,052
You all look the same to me.

945
01:24:56,691 --> 01:24:57,984
Take him.

946
01:25:04,616 --> 01:25:06,076
No!

947
01:25:11,206 --> 01:25:13,041
- Operator.
- <i>I need an exit, fast.</i>

948
01:25:15,126 --> 01:25:18,046
There was an accident.
Goddamn car accident.

949
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:20,173
<i>All of a sudden, boom.</i>

950
01:25:20,423 --> 01:25:21,800
Somebody up there still likes me.

951
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:23,301
I got you.

952
01:25:23,802 --> 01:25:25,720
<i>Just get me out of here fast.</i>

953
01:25:25,970 --> 01:25:28,640
Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.
An old TV repair shop.

954
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:29,933
Right.

955
01:25:33,061 --> 01:25:34,646
- Operator.
- <i>Tank, it's me.</i>

956
01:25:34,896 --> 01:25:36,064
Is Morpheus alive?

957
01:25:36,439 --> 01:25:37,732
Is Morpheus alive, Tank?

958
01:25:38,149 --> 01:25:40,068
<i>Yes. They're moving him.
I don't know where.</i>

959
01:25:40,276 --> 01:25:42,570
He's alive. We need an exit.

960
01:25:42,821 --> 01:25:43,905
You're not far from Cypher.

961
01:25:44,072 --> 01:25:45,323
- <i>Cypher?</i>
- I know.

962
01:25:45,573 --> 01:25:47,659
- <i>I sent him to Franklin and Erie.</i>
- Got it.

963
01:25:56,751 --> 01:25:57,961
Got him.

964
01:26:08,888 --> 01:26:09,931
Where are they?

965
01:26:10,181 --> 01:26:11,433
Making the call.

966
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:13,268
Good.

967
01:26:26,406 --> 01:26:27,657
You first.

968
01:26:30,869 --> 01:26:32,078
Shit!

969
01:26:35,373 --> 01:26:37,041
Tank!

970
01:26:37,208 --> 01:26:38,835
No!

971
01:26:40,753 --> 01:26:42,922
I don't know. It just went dead.

972
01:27:09,741 --> 01:27:10,950
<i>Hello, Trinity.</i>

973
01:27:11,367 --> 01:27:12,702
Cypher? Where's Tank?

974
01:27:18,291 --> 01:27:19,334
You know...

975
01:27:21,044 --> 01:27:23,171
...for a long time...

976
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:27,258
...I thought I was in love with you.

977
01:27:28,051 --> 01:27:30,094
<i>I used to dream about you.</i>

978
01:27:31,179 --> 01:27:33,890
You're a beautiful woman, Trinity.

979
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:36,518
<i>Too bad things had to turn out this way.</i>

980
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:38,102
You killed them.

981
01:27:38,603 --> 01:27:40,104
- What?
- Oh, God.

982
01:27:40,355 --> 01:27:41,773
I'm tired, Trinity.

983
01:27:43,191 --> 01:27:45,068
I'm tired of this war...

984
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,196
...tired of fighting.
I'm tired of this ship...

985
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:53,159
...of being cold, of eating
the same goddamn goop every day.

986
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:56,496
But most of all...

987
01:27:57,080 --> 01:28:00,458
<i>...I'm tired of that jackoff
and all of his bullshit.</i>

988
01:28:01,584 --> 01:28:02,877
Surprise, asshole!

989
01:28:03,419 --> 01:28:05,630
I bet you never saw this coming...

990
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:06,923
...did you?

991
01:28:09,217 --> 01:28:11,594
God, I wish I could be there...

992
01:28:12,178 --> 01:28:13,680
...when they break you.

993
01:28:14,722 --> 01:28:17,892
I wish I could walk in
just when it happens...

994
01:28:18,601 --> 01:28:20,311
...so right then...

995
01:28:20,562 --> 01:28:21,896
...you'd know it was me.

996
01:28:22,397 --> 01:28:23,565
You gave them Morpheus.

997
01:28:23,815 --> 01:28:25,275
<i>He lied to us, Trinity.</i>

998
01:28:25,858 --> 01:28:27,360
He tricked us!

999
01:28:27,902 --> 01:28:29,904
If you had told us the truth...

1000
01:28:30,154 --> 01:28:33,032
...we would've told you to shove
that red pill up your ass!

1001
01:28:33,283 --> 01:28:35,410
That is not true, Cypher.
He set us free.

1002
01:28:35,660 --> 01:28:38,538
"Free." You call this free?

1003
01:28:40,957 --> 01:28:43,459
All I do is what he tells me to do.

1004
01:28:45,044 --> 01:28:47,964
If I had to choose between
that and the Matrix...

1005
01:28:49,132 --> 01:28:50,341
...I choose the Matrix.

1006
01:28:50,592 --> 01:28:52,260
The Matrix isn't real.

1007
01:28:52,510 --> 01:28:53,928
<i>I disagree, Trinity.</i>

1008
01:28:54,178 --> 01:28:56,431
I think the Matrix...

1009
01:28:56,764 --> 01:28:59,350
...can be more real than this world.

1010
01:29:01,519 --> 01:29:04,022
All I do is pull the plug here.

1011
01:29:04,397 --> 01:29:05,607
But there...

1012
01:29:06,149 --> 01:29:08,443
<i>...you have to watch Apoc die.</i>

1013
01:29:09,444 --> 01:29:10,695
Trinity.

1014
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:19,162
- <i>Welcome to the real world.</i>
- But you're out, Cypher.

1015
01:29:19,412 --> 01:29:21,831
- <i>You can't go back.</i>
- That's what you think.

1016
01:29:22,081 --> 01:29:23,583
<i>They'll reinsert my body.</i>

1017
01:29:23,833 --> 01:29:27,462
<i>I go back to sleep. When I wake up,
I won't remember a thing.</i>

1018
01:29:27,670 --> 01:29:28,713
By the way...

1019
01:29:28,963 --> 01:29:31,924
...if you have anything
important to say to Switch...

1020
01:29:32,425 --> 01:29:33,509
<i>...say it now.</i>

1021
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:36,804
- No, please don't.
- Not like this.

1022
01:29:38,514 --> 01:29:40,141
Not like this.

1023
01:29:44,604 --> 01:29:45,647
Too late.

1024
01:29:46,397 --> 01:29:47,690
Goddamn you, Cypher!

1025
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:49,817
Don't hate me, Trinity.

1026
01:29:50,193 --> 01:29:52,070
I'm just a messenger.

1027
01:29:52,487 --> 01:29:55,657
And right now, I'm going to prove it to you.

1028
01:29:56,741 --> 01:29:58,409
If Morpheus was right...

1029
01:29:58,951 --> 01:30:00,828
...there's no way I can pull this plug.

1030
01:30:01,412 --> 01:30:02,914
<i>If Neo's the One...</i>

1031
01:30:03,414 --> 01:30:05,249
<i>...then there'd have to be...</i>

1032
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:08,086
...some kind of a miracle to stop me.

1033
01:30:08,252 --> 01:30:09,462
Right?

1034
01:30:10,088 --> 01:30:12,173
I mean, how can he be the One...

1035
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:13,424
...if he's dead?

1036
01:30:14,801 --> 01:30:17,053
<i>You never did answer me before...</i>

1037
01:30:17,345 --> 01:30:19,681
<i>...if you bought into Morpheus' bullshit.</i>

1038
01:30:20,056 --> 01:30:23,267
Come on. All I want is a little yes or no.

1039
01:30:24,644 --> 01:30:26,979
Look into his eyes...

1040
01:30:27,730 --> 01:30:29,232
<i>...those big, pretty eyes...</i>

1041
01:30:31,984 --> 01:30:33,319
...and tell me...

1042
01:30:34,028 --> 01:30:35,279
<i>...yes...</i>

1043
01:30:35,613 --> 01:30:36,989
<i>...or no.</i>

1044
01:30:38,282 --> 01:30:39,826
- Yes.
- <i>No!</i>

1045
01:30:39,992 --> 01:30:41,160
I don't believe it.

1046
01:30:42,578 --> 01:30:47,333
Believe it or not, you piece of shit,
you're still going to burn!

1047
01:31:05,601 --> 01:31:06,978
You first.

1048
01:31:15,194 --> 01:31:17,488
- You're hurt.
- I'll be all right.

1049
01:31:20,283 --> 01:31:21,451
Dozer?

1050
01:31:39,719 --> 01:31:42,096
Have you ever stood and stared at it?

1051
01:31:42,972 --> 01:31:46,100
Marveled at its beauty...

1052
01:31:46,476 --> 01:31:48,728
...its genius?

1053
01:31:49,896 --> 01:31:51,773
Billions of people...

1054
01:31:52,023 --> 01:31:54,776
...just living out their lives.

1055
01:31:55,818 --> 01:31:57,487
Oblivious.

1056
01:32:02,074 --> 01:32:04,952
Did you know that the first Matrix...

1057
01:32:05,203 --> 01:32:09,874
...was designed to be a perfect
human world where none suffered...

1058
01:32:10,374 --> 01:32:13,294
...where everyone would be happy.

1059
01:32:13,836 --> 01:32:15,338
It was a disaster.

1060
01:32:15,588 --> 01:32:19,926
No one would accept the program.
Entire crops were lost.

1061
01:32:20,802 --> 01:32:22,553
Some believe that...

1062
01:32:22,804 --> 01:32:27,183
...we lacked the programming language
to describe your perfect world.

1063
01:32:27,433 --> 01:32:28,976
But I believe that...

1064
01:32:29,143 --> 01:32:30,311
...as a species...

1065
01:32:30,561 --> 01:32:34,398
...human beings define
their reality through misery...

1066
01:32:34,649 --> 01:32:36,025
...and suffering.

1067
01:32:36,275 --> 01:32:38,986
So the perfect world was a dream...

1068
01:32:39,237 --> 01:32:44,075
...that your primitive cerebrum
kept trying to wake up from.

1069
01:32:45,409 --> 01:32:49,080
Which is why the Matrix
was redesigned to this.

1070
01:32:49,539 --> 01:32:51,040
The peak...

1071
01:32:51,290 --> 01:32:52,708
...of your civilization.

1072
01:32:52,959 --> 01:32:55,211
I say, "your civilization"...

1073
01:32:55,461 --> 01:32:59,590
...because when we started thinking
for you, it became our civilization...

1074
01:32:59,841 --> 01:33:02,927
...which is, of course,
what this is all about.

1075
01:33:04,262 --> 01:33:06,848
Evolution, Morpheus.

1076
01:33:07,139 --> 01:33:08,474
Evolution.

1077
01:33:10,768 --> 01:33:12,645
Like the dinosaur.

1078
01:33:14,814 --> 01:33:16,440
Look out that window.

1079
01:33:17,149 --> 01:33:19,277
You had your time.

1080
01:33:19,986 --> 01:33:23,906
The future is our world, Morpheus.

1081
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:26,617
The future is our time.

1082
01:33:30,872 --> 01:33:32,039
There could be a problem.

1083
01:33:32,957 --> 01:33:36,335
- What are they doing to him?
- They're breaking into his mind.

1084
01:33:36,586 --> 01:33:38,754
It's like hacking a computer.
All it takes is time.

1085
01:33:39,005 --> 01:33:40,214
How much time?

1086
01:33:40,464 --> 01:33:43,593
Depends on the mind.
But eventually, it'll crack...

1087
01:33:43,843 --> 01:33:48,264
...and his alpha patterns
will change from this to this.

1088
01:33:48,514 --> 01:33:51,475
When it does, he'll tell them
anything they want to know.

1089
01:33:51,726 --> 01:33:52,768
What do they want?

1090
01:33:53,019 --> 01:33:57,064
The leader of every ship is given codes
to Zion's mainframe computer.

1091
01:33:57,315 --> 01:34:00,234
If an agent got the codes and
got into Zion's mainframe...

1092
01:34:00,484 --> 01:34:03,571
...they could destroy us.
We can't let that happen.

1093
01:34:03,738 --> 01:34:05,990
Trinity, Zion's more important than me...

1094
01:34:06,157 --> 01:34:07,325
...or you...

1095
01:34:07,491 --> 01:34:08,784
...or even Morpheus.

1096
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:14,248
There has to be something we can do.

1097
01:34:14,665 --> 01:34:16,667
There is. We pull the plug.

1098
01:34:19,754 --> 01:34:21,505
You're going to kill him?

1099
01:34:21,756 --> 01:34:22,924
Kill Morpheus?

1100
01:34:23,549 --> 01:34:25,176
We don't have a choice.

1101
01:34:31,974 --> 01:34:34,894
Never send a human to do a machine's job.

1102
01:34:35,144 --> 01:34:36,896
If the insider has failed...

1103
01:34:37,146 --> 01:34:40,358
...they'll sever the connection
as soon as possible, unless...

1104
01:34:40,608 --> 01:34:42,318
They're dead. In either case...

1105
01:34:42,568 --> 01:34:46,113
We have no choice. Continue as planned.
Deploy the sentinels.

1106
01:34:46,364 --> 01:34:47,448
Immediately.

1107
01:34:52,703 --> 01:34:55,373
Morpheus, you were more
than a leader to us.

1108
01:34:56,332 --> 01:34:58,542
You were a father.

1109
01:35:00,086 --> 01:35:02,046
We'll miss you always.

1110
01:35:08,928 --> 01:35:10,137
Stop!

1111
01:35:11,305 --> 01:35:12,640
I don't believe this is happening.

1112
01:35:12,807 --> 01:35:14,850
- Neo, this has to be done.
- Does it?

1113
01:35:15,643 --> 01:35:17,019
I don't know.

1114
01:35:17,353 --> 01:35:19,814
- This can't be just coincidence.
- What?

1115
01:35:20,022 --> 01:35:21,273
The Oracle.

1116
01:35:21,524 --> 01:35:23,317
She told me this would happen.

1117
01:35:23,734 --> 01:35:27,905
She told me that I would
have to make a choice.

1118
01:35:28,364 --> 01:35:29,573
What choice?

1119
01:35:32,576 --> 01:35:35,079
- What are you doing?
- I'm going in.

1120
01:35:35,413 --> 01:35:37,748
- No, you're not.
- I have to.

1121
01:35:37,957 --> 01:35:41,585
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out.

1122
01:35:41,836 --> 01:35:43,754
There is no way that you're going back in.

1123
01:35:44,338 --> 01:35:47,591
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed I'm something I'm not.

1124
01:35:49,093 --> 01:35:50,136
What?

1125
01:35:50,845 --> 01:35:52,471
I'm not the One, Trinity.

1126
01:35:52,847 --> 01:35:55,808
- The Oracle hit me with that too.
- No, you have to be.

1127
01:35:56,058 --> 01:35:58,728
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm just another guy.

1128
01:35:59,395 --> 01:36:00,646
No, Neo, that's not true.

1129
01:36:01,230 --> 01:36:03,858
- It can't be true.
- Why?

1130
01:36:08,279 --> 01:36:11,615
This is loco. They've got Morpheus
in a military-controlled building.

1131
01:36:11,866 --> 01:36:16,245
Even if you somehow got inside,
those are agents holding him. Three of them.

1132
01:36:17,538 --> 01:36:21,459
I want Morpheus back too,
but what you're talking about is suicide.

1133
01:36:21,709 --> 01:36:23,294
That's what it looks like...

1134
01:36:23,461 --> 01:36:24,503
...but it's not.

1135
01:36:24,754 --> 01:36:27,131
I can't explain to you why it's not.

1136
01:36:28,215 --> 01:36:31,927
Morpheus believed something,
and he was ready to give his life for it.

1137
01:36:32,178 --> 01:36:35,181
I understand that now.
That's why I have to go.

1138
01:36:35,473 --> 01:36:37,975
- Why?
- Because I believe in something.

1139
01:36:38,142 --> 01:36:39,769
What?

1140
01:36:40,478 --> 01:36:42,188
I believe I can bring him back.

1141
01:36:59,163 --> 01:37:01,082
- What are you doing?
- Going with you.

1142
01:37:01,373 --> 01:37:03,375
- No, you're not.
- "No"?

1143
01:37:04,543 --> 01:37:06,670
Let me tell you what I believe.

1144
01:37:07,171 --> 01:37:09,548
Morpheus means more to me
than he does to you.

1145
01:37:09,882 --> 01:37:14,178
I believe if you are serious about
saving him, you will need my help.

1146
01:37:14,428 --> 01:37:16,472
And since I am the ranking officer...

1147
01:37:16,722 --> 01:37:19,600
...if you don't like it,
I believe you can go to hell.

1148
01:37:20,351 --> 01:37:22,770
Because you aren't going anywhere else.

1149
01:37:23,187 --> 01:37:24,730
Tank...

1150
01:37:24,897 --> 01:37:26,023
...load us up.

1151
01:37:35,658 --> 01:37:38,953
I'd like to share
a revelation that I've had...

1152
01:37:39,370 --> 01:37:40,913
...during my time here.

1153
01:37:41,163 --> 01:37:45,167
It came to me when I tried
to classify your species...

1154
01:37:45,417 --> 01:37:47,670
...and I realized...

1155
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:50,214
...that you're not actually mammals.

1156
01:37:52,424 --> 01:37:54,885
Every mammal on this planet...

1157
01:37:55,219 --> 01:38:00,141
...instinctively develops an equilibrium
with the surrounding environment.

1158
01:38:00,391 --> 01:38:02,226
But you humans do not.

1159
01:38:02,768 --> 01:38:06,313
You move to an area and you multiply...

1160
01:38:06,564 --> 01:38:11,068
...and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed.

1161
01:38:11,402 --> 01:38:13,487
The only way you can survive...

1162
01:38:13,779 --> 01:38:16,740
...is to spread to another area.

1163
01:38:22,163 --> 01:38:25,040
There is another organism on this planet...

1164
01:38:25,291 --> 01:38:27,251
...that follows the same pattern.

1165
01:38:27,877 --> 01:38:29,545
Do you know what it is?

1166
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:31,755
A virus.

1167
01:38:33,090 --> 01:38:36,135
Human beings are a disease.

1168
01:38:36,510 --> 01:38:38,053
A cancer of this planet.

1169
01:38:38,304 --> 01:38:40,431
You are a plague.

1170
01:38:40,973 --> 01:38:42,391
And we...

1171
01:38:42,558 --> 01:38:43,934
...are the cure.

1172
01:38:44,935 --> 01:38:46,353
Okay, so what do you need?

1173
01:38:46,979 --> 01:38:48,105
Besides a miracle.

1174
01:38:48,689 --> 01:38:49,899
Guns.

1175
01:38:50,733 --> 01:38:51,942
Lots of guns.

1176
01:39:01,827 --> 01:39:03,037
Neo...

1177
01:39:04,788 --> 01:39:07,333
No one has ever done anything like this.

1178
01:39:08,542 --> 01:39:10,461
That's why it's going to work.

1179
01:39:14,548 --> 01:39:16,467
Why isn't the serum working?

1180
01:39:17,092 --> 01:39:19,386
Perhaps we're asking the wrong questions.

1181
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:22,723
Leave me with him.

1182
01:39:25,309 --> 01:39:26,435
Now.

1183
01:39:37,655 --> 01:39:39,240
Hold on, Morpheus.

1184
01:39:39,490 --> 01:39:42,201
They're coming for you.
They're coming.

1185
01:39:44,578 --> 01:39:46,705
Can you hear me, Morpheus?

1186
01:39:46,956 --> 01:39:49,625
I'm going to be honest...

1187
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,210
...with you.

1188
01:39:55,589 --> 01:39:57,007
I...

1189
01:39:57,883 --> 01:39:59,009
...hate...

1190
01:39:59,260 --> 01:40:01,220
...this place...

1191
01:40:01,553 --> 01:40:03,847
...this zoo...

1192
01:40:04,098 --> 01:40:05,224
...this prison...

1193
01:40:05,474 --> 01:40:08,644
...this reality, whatever you want to call it.

1194
01:40:08,894 --> 01:40:11,188
I can't stand it any longer.

1195
01:40:11,939 --> 01:40:13,816
It's the smell.

1196
01:40:15,192 --> 01:40:17,069
If there is such a thing.

1197
01:40:17,403 --> 01:40:20,698
I feel saturated by it.

1198
01:40:22,199 --> 01:40:23,492
I can...

1199
01:40:23,742 --> 01:40:25,286
...taste...

1200
01:40:25,452 --> 01:40:27,496
...your stink.

1201
01:40:27,746 --> 01:40:31,375
And every time I do, I fear that I
have somehow been infected by it.

1202
01:40:31,542 --> 01:40:32,543
It's repulsive.

1203
01:40:33,544 --> 01:40:34,920
Isn't it?

1204
01:40:37,089 --> 01:40:39,383
I must get out of here.

1205
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:42,011
I must get free.

1206
01:40:42,261 --> 01:40:45,139
And in this mind is the key.

1207
01:40:45,389 --> 01:40:47,057
My key.

1208
01:40:47,308 --> 01:40:50,185
Once Zion is destroyed, there
is no need for me to be here.

1209
01:40:50,436 --> 01:40:52,062
Do you understand?

1210
01:40:52,354 --> 01:40:53,731
I need the codes.

1211
01:40:53,981 --> 01:40:56,317
I have to get inside Zion...

1212
01:40:56,650 --> 01:40:59,153
...and you have to tell me how.

1213
01:40:59,570 --> 01:41:01,447
You're going to tell me...

1214
01:41:01,697 --> 01:41:03,866
...or you're going to die.

1215
01:41:24,053 --> 01:41:27,181
Please remove any metallic items
you're carrying. Keys, loose change.

1216
01:41:31,101 --> 01:41:32,144
Holy shit!

1217
01:41:44,239 --> 01:41:46,950
Backup. Send backup.

1218
01:42:10,766 --> 01:42:11,892
Freeze!

1219
01:44:26,735 --> 01:44:27,945
What were you doing?

1220
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:31,073
He doesn't know.

1221
01:44:31,323 --> 01:44:32,824
Know what?

1222
01:45:00,894 --> 01:45:03,397
I think they're trying to save him.

1223
01:45:18,245 --> 01:45:19,997
There is no spoon.

1224
01:45:49,610 --> 01:45:51,778
Find them and destroy them!

1225
01:45:53,405 --> 01:45:55,240
We're under attack!

1226
01:46:27,356 --> 01:46:28,523
Trinity!

1227
01:46:29,024 --> 01:46:30,108
Help!

1228
01:46:52,130 --> 01:46:53,340
Only human.

1229
01:46:54,299 --> 01:46:55,384
Dodge this.

1230
01:47:08,605 --> 01:47:10,107
- How did you do that?
- Do what?

1231
01:47:10,524 --> 01:47:14,444
You moved like they do.
I've never seen anyone move that fast.

1232
01:47:15,570 --> 01:47:16,947
It wasn't fast enough.

1233
01:47:19,700 --> 01:47:20,992
Can you fly that thing?

1234
01:47:22,119 --> 01:47:23,120
Not yet.

1235
01:47:26,415 --> 01:47:27,457
Operator.

1236
01:47:27,666 --> 01:47:30,836
<i>I need a pilot program
for a B-212 helicopter.</i>

1237
01:47:31,294 --> 01:47:32,587
<i>Hurry.</i>

1238
01:47:40,512 --> 01:47:42,139
Let's go.

1239
01:47:57,237 --> 01:47:58,321
No.

1240
01:48:49,915 --> 01:48:52,542
Morpheus, get up.
Get up, get up.

1241
01:49:30,580 --> 01:49:31,623
He's not going to make it.

1242
01:49:41,424 --> 01:49:42,467
Got you.

1243
01:50:48,533 --> 01:50:49,701
Trinity!

1244
01:51:31,368 --> 01:51:32,786
I knew it.

1245
01:51:33,411 --> 01:51:34,621
He's the One.

1246
01:51:50,595 --> 01:51:52,806
Do you believe it now, Trinity?

1247
01:51:55,684 --> 01:51:56,851
Morpheus...

1248
01:51:58,520 --> 01:51:59,604
The Oracle.

1249
01:52:00,855 --> 01:52:03,233
- She told me...
- She told you...

1250
01:52:03,608 --> 01:52:05,193
...what you needed to hear.

1251
01:52:05,485 --> 01:52:06,820
That's all.

1252
01:52:07,862 --> 01:52:10,824
Sooner or later you'll realize,
just as I did...

1253
01:52:11,157 --> 01:52:13,451
...there's a difference
between knowing the path...

1254
01:52:14,202 --> 01:52:15,495
...and walking the path.

1255
01:52:18,540 --> 01:52:19,749
- Operator.
- <i>Tank.</i>

1256
01:52:20,667 --> 01:52:23,211
- It's good to hear your voice.
- <i>We need an exit.</i>

1257
01:52:23,461 --> 01:52:26,256
Got one ready.
Subway station, State and Balboa.

1258
01:52:39,310 --> 01:52:41,730
- Damn it!
- The trace was completed.

1259
01:52:41,980 --> 01:52:45,567
- We have their position.
- Sentinels are standing by.

1260
01:52:47,277 --> 01:52:48,778
Order the strike.

1261
01:52:55,326 --> 01:52:57,328
They're not out yet.

1262
01:53:08,506 --> 01:53:09,841
You first, Morpheus.

1263
01:53:30,528 --> 01:53:32,822
Neo, I want to tell you something...

1264
01:53:36,076 --> 01:53:40,038
...but I'm afraid of what
it could mean if I do.

1265
01:53:43,625 --> 01:53:46,920
Everything the Oracle
told me has come true.

1266
01:53:49,672 --> 01:53:51,216
Everything but this.

1267
01:53:52,717 --> 01:53:53,760
But what?

1268
01:54:18,660 --> 01:54:19,828
Neo!

1269
01:54:20,078 --> 01:54:21,704
- What happened?
- An agent.

1270
01:54:21,955 --> 01:54:23,873
- Send me back.
- I can't.

1271
01:54:25,917 --> 01:54:27,877
Mr. Anderson.

1272
01:54:30,088 --> 01:54:31,464
Run, Neo. Run.

1273
01:54:36,761 --> 01:54:38,388
What is he doing?

1274
01:54:38,638 --> 01:54:39,889
He's beginning to believe.

1275
01:55:06,875 --> 01:55:08,251
You're empty.

1276
01:55:08,835 --> 01:55:10,128
So are you.

1277
01:55:43,286 --> 01:55:46,289
I'm going to enjoy watching you die...

1278
01:55:47,415 --> 01:55:48,458
...Mr. Anderson.

1279
01:56:29,415 --> 01:56:31,501
Jesus, he's killing him.

1280
01:57:57,670 --> 01:57:59,797
You hear that, Mr. Anderson?

1281
01:58:00,548 --> 01:58:03,551
That is the sound of inevitability.

1282
01:58:06,137 --> 01:58:09,474
It is the sound of your death.

1283
01:58:10,391 --> 01:58:12,727
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1284
01:58:12,977 --> 01:58:14,604
My name...

1285
01:58:17,607 --> 01:58:19,650
...is Neo.

1286
01:58:51,891 --> 01:58:54,102
- What happened?
- I don't know. I lost him.

1287
01:58:56,604 --> 01:58:57,647
Oh, shit.

1288
01:59:10,034 --> 01:59:11,494
Sentinels.

1289
01:59:12,245 --> 01:59:14,497
- How long?
- Five, maybe six minutes.

1290
01:59:16,541 --> 01:59:18,709
Tank, charge the EMP.

1291
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:22,004
- We can't use that until he's out.
- I know. Don't worry.

1292
01:59:23,172 --> 01:59:24,257
He's gonna make it.

1293
01:59:24,507 --> 01:59:26,384
Flat or pumps? No, just...

1294
01:59:26,634 --> 01:59:29,512
What the shit? That's my phone!

1295
01:59:29,929 --> 01:59:31,514
That guy took my phone!

1296
01:59:33,891 --> 01:59:36,185
Got him!
He's on the run.

1297
01:59:36,436 --> 01:59:39,105
Mr. Wizard, get me out of here!

1298
01:59:39,355 --> 01:59:41,232
<i>I got an old exit.
Wabash and Lake.</i>

1299
01:59:45,194 --> 01:59:46,195
Oh, shit!

1300
02:00:07,758 --> 02:00:09,760
Help! Need a little help!

1301
02:00:11,387 --> 02:00:12,597
<i>The door.</i>

1302
02:00:28,571 --> 02:00:30,072
<i>The door on your left.</i>

1303
02:00:30,990 --> 02:00:32,241
<i>Your other left!</i>

1304
02:00:38,956 --> 02:00:40,208
<i>The back door.</i>

1305
02:01:00,978 --> 02:01:02,104
Oh, no.

1306
02:01:03,773 --> 02:01:05,274
Here they come.

1307
02:01:34,053 --> 02:01:35,304
He's going to make it.

1308
02:01:45,523 --> 02:01:48,651
<i>The fire escape at the end
of the alley, room 303.</i>

1309
02:02:23,769 --> 02:02:24,854
They're inside.

1310
02:02:27,189 --> 02:02:28,232
Hurry, Neo.

1311
02:03:24,455 --> 02:03:25,581
It can't be.

1312
02:03:33,381 --> 02:03:34,757
Check him.

1313
02:03:38,761 --> 02:03:40,304
He's gone.

1314
02:03:47,019 --> 02:03:49,438
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1315
02:03:57,029 --> 02:03:58,072
Neo...

1316
02:03:59,532 --> 02:04:01,492
I'm not afraid anymore.

1317
02:04:03,119 --> 02:04:04,453
The Oracle told me...

1318
02:04:04,620 --> 02:04:10,042
...I'd fall in love, and that the man
I loved would be the One.

1319
02:04:13,170 --> 02:04:15,131
So you see...

1320
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:17,842
...you can't be dead.

1321
02:04:19,427 --> 02:04:21,262
You can't be...

1322
02:04:22,805 --> 02:04:24,974
...because I love you.

1323
02:04:26,809 --> 02:04:28,519
You hear me?

1324
02:04:29,645 --> 02:04:31,313
I love you.

1325
02:04:55,045 --> 02:04:56,338
Now, get up.

1326
02:05:05,014 --> 02:05:06,182
No.

1327
02:05:32,917 --> 02:05:33,959
How?

1328
02:05:34,835 --> 02:05:35,878
He is the One.

1329
02:07:02,631 --> 02:07:04,091
Neo!

1330
02:08:00,356 --> 02:08:02,066
<i>I know you're out there.</i>

1331
02:08:02,316 --> 02:08:04,151
<i>I can feel you now.</i>

1332
02:08:04,568 --> 02:08:08,197
<i>I know that you're afraid.
You're afraid of us.</i>

1333
02:08:08,530 --> 02:08:10,366
<i>You're afraid of change.</i>

1334
02:08:11,825 --> 02:08:13,160
<i>I don't know the future.</i>

1335
02:08:13,327 --> 02:08:15,913
<i>I didn't come here to tell you
how this is going to end.</i>

1336
02:08:16,163 --> 02:08:19,124
<i>I came here to tell you
how it's going to begin.</i>

1337
02:08:20,084 --> 02:08:21,669
<i>I'll hang up this phone.</i>

1338
02:08:21,919 --> 02:08:25,005
<i>And then I'll show these people
what you don't want them to see.</i>

1339
02:08:25,255 --> 02:08:27,132
<i>I'm going to show them a world...</i>

1340
02:08:27,383 --> 02:08:29,134
<i>...without you.</i>

1341
02:08:29,426 --> 02:08:33,055
<i>A world without rules and controls,
without borders or boundaries.</i>

1342
02:08:33,305 --> 02:08:37,017
<i>A world where anything is possible.</i>

1343
02:08:39,645 --> 02:08:40,980
<i>Where we go from there...</i>

1344
02:08:41,230 --> 02:08:43,190
<i>...is a choice I leave to you.</i>
